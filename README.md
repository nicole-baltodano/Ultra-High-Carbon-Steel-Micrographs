# "Multimodal Classification of Microconstituents in Ultra High Carbon Steel"

## üìå Overview  
This project applies a **multimodal deep learning approach** to classify microconstituents in high-carbon steel micrographs. It integrates **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image-based classification and a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** for numerical/tabular data to improve prediction accuracy.

## üî¨ Project Motivation  
Heat treatment significantly impacts the microstructure of steel, influencing its mechanical properties. Accurately classifying microconstituents‚Äîsuch as **spheroidite, pearlite, and network**‚Äîis critical for quality control in metallurgy. This project explores the **feasibility of deep learning models** in predicting these microstructures using **image and numerical data**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing  
- **Numerical Features**: Standardized **annealing temperature and time** using `StandardScaler()`.  
- **Categorical Features**: One-hot encoded **cooling method**.  
- **Image Processing**: Resized images and normalized pixel values.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architecture  
- **CNN for Image Processing**  
  - Convolutional layers extract features from steel micrographs.  
  - Max-pooling layers reduce dimensionality.  
  - Fully connected layers generate embeddings for classification.  

- **MLP for Numerical Features**  
  - Dense layers process annealing parameters and cooling methods.  
  - Integrated with CNN embeddings for final prediction.  

- **Final Classification**  
  - Softmax activation for multi-class classification (`spheroidite`, `pearlite`, `network`).

## üìä Results & Analysis  
- **Overall Model Accuracy**: **81%**  
- **Spheroidite Recall**: **0.95** (Excellent classification performance)  
- **Network Recall**: **0.30** (Struggled with identification)  
- **Pearlite Classification**: **Not predicted** due to extreme underrepresentation  

### Key Insights  
‚úî CNN model **successfully classifies spheroidite** with high accuracy.  
‚ö† **Underrepresented classes (pearlite, network) require augmentation** for better balance.  
‚ùå Model **fails to classify pearlite** due to lack of samples.
